# Style Guides

## Formatting

* Always use soft tab (2 spaces) to indent. Never tab!
* Keep as possible the line break at 80 columns.
* Remove trailing spaces.
* Keep a line break at end of the file.

In addition to the general guidelines above, we also have the following more detailed, language/framework-specific style guides:

* [Ruby](/style-guides/ruby)
* [Ruby on Rails](/style-guides/ruby-on-rails)
